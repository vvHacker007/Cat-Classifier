# Cat-Classifier
This is a binary Cat Classifier made by hard coding Neural Networks in Python without using libraries such as Tensorflow or keras.
The Notebook has been briefly documented which would clear all the basic mathematical part of a Neural Networks and how they work.
Feel free to frok it and learn from it.
