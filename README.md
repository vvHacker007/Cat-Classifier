# Cat-Classifier
This is a **Binary Cat Classifier** made by hard coding Neural Networks in Python **without using libraries such as Tensorflow or keras.**
The model works well on the **testing data** with **accuracy of around 75%** .
The Notebook has been briefly documented which would clear all the basic mathematical part of a Neural Networks and how they work.
Feel free to frok it and learn from it.
